# Text-Mining

Text mining (also known as text analysis), is the process of transforming unstructured text into structured data for easy analysis. Text mining uses natural language processing (NLP), allowing machines to understand the human language and process it automatically. Methods for Text mining are :-

Word frequency:- It is used to identify the most recurrent terms or concepts in a set of data.
Collocation:- It refers to a sequence of words that commonly appear near each other. The most common types of collocations are bigrams and trigrams.
Concordance :- It is used to recognize the particular context or instance in which a word or set of words appears.
Text Classification:- It is the process of assigning categories (tags) to unstructured text data. This essential task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) makes it easy to organize and structure complex text, turning it into meaningful data. a) Topic Analysis:- It helps you understand the main themes or subjects of a text, and is one of the main ways of organizing text data . b) Sentiment analysis :- It helps you understand the opinion and feelings in a text, and classify them as positive, negative or neutral. c) Language Detection:- It allows you to classify a text based on its language. d) Intent Detection:- It is used to recognize the intentions or the purpose behind a text automatically.
Text Extraction:- It extracts specific pieces of data from a text, like keywords, entity names, addresses, emails, etc. a) Keyword Extraction:- keywords are the most relevant terms within a text and can be used to summarize its content. Utilizing a keyword extractor allows you to index data to be searched, summarize the content of a text or create tag clouds, among other things. b) Named Entity Recognition:- It allows you to identify and extract the names of companies, organizations or persons from a text. c) Feature Extraction:- It helps identify specific characteristics of a product or service in a set of data.
